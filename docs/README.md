# Project Documentation

Welcome to the project documentation. This section is organized to provide clear and accessible information for developers, contributors, and anyone interested in understanding the project's architecture, setup, and history.

## Structure

The documentation is divided into the following sections:

- [**Architecture**](./architecture/): Contains detailed explanations of the project's technical design, patterns, and core components. If you want to understand _how_ the system is built, this is the place to start.

- [**Guides**](./guides/): Provides practical, step-by-step instructions for setting up, configuring, and using specific parts of the project. Use these guides to get features up and running.

Please navigate to the relevant section to find the information you need.
